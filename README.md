## Designing Socially Acceptable Light Therapy Glasses for Self-managing Seasonal Affective Disorder
This service was part of an IoT project where I made a Wearable Light Therapy device for self-managing Seasonal Affective Disorder. While the server side of the project was never fully implemented, due to the device WiFi antenna breaking, the project was published by 'AHs'21: Augmented Humans Conference 2021'.
