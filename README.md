## Light Therapy Glasses for Self-managing Seasonal Affective Disorder
This service was part of an IoT project where I made a Wearable Light Therapy device for self-managing Seasonal Affective Disorder. While the server side of the project was never fully implemented, due to the device WiFi antenna breaking, the project was published by 'AHs'21: Augmented Humans Conference 2021'. The paper can be accessed here: https://doi.org/10.1145/3458709.3458995

The device was pretty simple - a 3D printed glass frame with embedded LED lights, custom capacitive touch controls and an Arduino Nano. A lot of effort was put into making the device small and possible to wear.
